ZCD - Zero Configuration Dispatchers
This package builds a framework with which is possible to make Remote Procedure
Call onto nodes in the neighborhood or elsewhere.
The ''ntkd'' daemon depends on it.

It has some peculiar features:
 * It supports broadcast (or multicast) messages (procedure call) to the nodes
   in the neighborhood.
 * The node does not need to have a route in the tables in order to send a
   message (procedure call) to a specific node in the neighborhood.
 * It is NIC-centric. A message (procedure call) can tell which NIC of the source
   node it comes from and to which NIC of the destination node it is sent.
 * It supports the presence of multiple identities on a single node.
